        <p>
            Quod is an abstract strategy game played on an 11-by-11 grid of spaces
            with the four corner spaces removed. Players alternate placing pieces,
            called quods, into empty spaces. A player wins by placing four quods
            that form the four corners of a square. The square can be any size and
            any orientation (in other words, the square can be "tilted").
        </p>
        <p>    
            In addition, each player has a small number of pieces, called quasars,
            that are used purely for blocking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quod was invented by G. Keith Stills in 1979, while he was at college,
            and was popularized by Scientific American in March 1996.
